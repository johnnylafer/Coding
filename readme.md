# üßê Project philosophy

> Outdoor spaces currently don't provide enough space for people to interact.
We are trying to update the existing Kinect libraries and create a new interactive Experience for the outdoor spaces in which we incorporate existing elements like sand (see magic sand) as well as gamification in order to create an incentive for people to spend more time outdoors, even after dark.

**Find out more about our project on (WIP)[the project homepage](https://ftre.co).**

# üìí Important Resources / Wiki

While working on the project we are writing [a great wiki](https://github.com/) (currently WIP) which should hopefully explain most of what we do and also show you how to contribute to our project.
